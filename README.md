# solved-folder-copy-script
A bash script to automate copying solved folders into the student repo

1. Open the copy_solved.sh file

2. Change the baseSrc variable to the absolute path of your full stack flex class content directory

3. Change the baseDest variable to the absolute path of your UNCHILL... gitlab (student content) directory

4. Save, optionally add this folder to your PATH variable (or put the .sh file in one of your bins), and run! Happy copying!
